# RLL Pipeline

This is based off of my summer research project. This is essentially revised and significantly (soon to be) improved code from that project. The formatting is based on how MALS data is formatted, but other data cubes can **probably** be configured for it to successfully run. 

Compared to the original project. It uses more robust statistical formulas and an automated polynomial fit process by minimized the reduced chi squared statistic.
