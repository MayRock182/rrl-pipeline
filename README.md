# RLL Pipeline

This is based off of my summer research project in the search for radio recombination lines using spectral line stacking. This is essentially revised and significantly (soon to be) improved code from that project. The formatting is based on how MALS data is formatted, but other data cubes can **probably** be configured similarly for it to successfully run. 

Compared to the original project. It uses more robust statistical formulas and an automated polynomial fit process by minimized the reduced chi squared statistic. 

P.S. I am a novice at using github and coding in more than one file. So, I am using this as a challenge to improve the quality of my coding skills!
