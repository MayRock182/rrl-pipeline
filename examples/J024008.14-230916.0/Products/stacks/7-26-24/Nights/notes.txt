This is the first iteration of stacking.

Format # Night:
[Velocity (km/s), Unweighted Flux (Jy/Beam), Weighted Flux (Jy/Beam), Curve Fit (Jy/Beam)]

Format RMS Curve:
[# of RRLs, Unweighted RMS Stack (Jy/Beam), Weighted RMS Stack (Jy/Beam), Curve fit (Jy/Beam)]
 
* Recommend to do a 1/sqrt(N) fit factored by the median RMS

How these were stacked:
  - No spectra were discarded based off of the rms curve
  - Discard criteria during processing
	* All edge cases that were ~+50 cut off were discarded (very conservative)
	* Any absorption lines in case it was RFI absorption that could meddle with the data
	* Any p values <0.05 since as a way to determine whether any spikes made the data non 
	  gaussian mathematically deemed non-gaussian
  - Are weighted by 1/sqrt(rms)
  - Baseline fitting was done with a polynomial fit

Summaries (weighted)
Night 1:
No RFI absorption at -150

Night 2:
No RFI absorption at -150

Night 3:
No RFI absorption at -150
2.5sig ~7 chan wide absorption feature 200?

Night 4:
Similar 2.5sig absorption feature at -150
Also similar  2.5 sig absorption feature at -650

Night 5:
One insignificant ~2.5 spike at 225
One ~3sig spike at -650

Night 6:
Single channel 2.5sig single channel absorption

Conclusion: 
Looking back, individual nights have a slight absorption
bias at -150 which must have come through in the complete stack
In the final stack, the dip between the two gaussian curves are at the ~ -150 km/s 
channel 
It is confirmed that one of the peaks is at 3sig and the other at ~2.25
